## Syllabus [v.1.0](https://github.com/troyth/age-of-the-architect/versions.md)

This class is part of an attempt to develop a new architectural canon by a study of the occult. It proceeds from the hypothesis that architecture has an origin, or series of early archetypal forms and functions, that can now be deciphered.

Precisely now. Implicit in this approach is the idea that architecture's beginnings have been systematically occulted–hidden–allowing architecture history as we know it to grow in the resulting vacuum. Amateurs untethered to dominant paradigms of theory have long chipped away at the underlying cosmologies and codes that informed sacred and public architecture from the pyramids to post-modernism, but it's only after decades on Internet connected sharing, collation, and comparison of this information with the hard data of maps and artifacts and new scientific methods of analyzing them that the hegemony of the official story is breaking down.

A new story is emerging in the cracks between architecture history and contemporary science and technology. It is a conspiratorial counterhistory that you won't read about in architecture discourse because it was constructed under the veil that architecture discourse offered. We will piece together this story as a universal codex to unlock mysteries hidden in architecture past and present that have urgent lessons for today.

This story requires turning most of what you think you know upside down. It takes place down the rabbit hole of anomalous events and impossible evidence. It is built on a science of telepathy and psychokinesis, the acrobatics of mind that have recently been shown to exist. It traces the connection between cave art and psychedelics and CIA mind control programs and Burning Man and Elon Musk's rockets. It relies on quantum mechanics and has something to say about artificial intelligence. It passes through the darkness of eugenics and neo-monarchism into decentralized currencies like Bitcoin, aliens, UFOs, and astrology. Ultimately, you will be given a wide spectrum of informational contraband from which to construct your own cosmology to recontextualize architecture in time for your own practice.


#### Premise
The purpose of this course is to end the semester with each student having a viable definition of "architect." It begins from the premise that "architect" is unable to be defined in abstract, that an absolute architecture is not possible. Rather, to define "architect" we must begin from a cosmology. This course will present a particular cosmology, the fundamental esoteric framework of Western civilization. We will encounter it both through occult texts and recently unmasked interpretations and challenge it with bleeding edge science that is beginning to emerge in just the past few months.

#### Deliverables
You will collectively develop a *Playbook of Inclusions*, a catalogue of various architecture-specific techniques for stretching reality to be more inclusive of experiences outside of Official Reality.

#### Methodology
*We will update our methodology this year. See [here]() for a breakdown from last year.*

Each class will be split into two parts: discussion and lecture. The lectures will provide a lens for making sense of the readings in a new way. The texts will be architecture writings, canonical and fringe, new and old, well-known and obscure. The objective will be to collectively decipher architecture history by borrowing theoretical frameworks from very recent new discoveries in a myriad of fields, from particle physics and the ethics of artificial intelligence to occult literature and declassified CIA projects.

#### Bibliography
The lectures will introduce ideas from [this ever-growing long list](bibliography.md) of books, manifestoes, essays, papers, reports, articles, videos, and social media posts. The readings will come from architecture discourse to be determined.
