## Syllabus [v.1.0](https://github.com/troyth/age-of-the-architect/versions.md)

Why do the contemporary deities of tech pray to the pagan gods of Burning Man? Why does Elon Musk believe we are living inside of a simulation? Why does Peter Thiel hold a New Zealand passport? Why did Alex Jones think the Sandy Hook mass murder was a hoax? What does any of this have to do with architecture? To begin to formulate an answer to these questions we need to go back to the beginning.

Origin stories are the magical commodity of architecture theory: they grant legitimacy while skirting falsifiability. They command worldviews without offering proof. They are the perpetual motion machines of authority. Vitruvius understood this. So did Banham. Laugier is remembered for little more than his.

After at least two millennia of speculation, origin stories have fallen out of favor in architecture theory just as accelerationist conspiracy theorists, Evangelical pastors, alt-right meme magicians, and avant garde political technologists have employed them at scale to shift global order. But reactionaries do not have a monopoly on deep time; science has also begun to lay a new claim on pre-history. Recent discoveries in evolutionary psychology, archaeology, paleoanthropology, paleontology, paleoclimatology, anthropogeny, primatology, deep history and neuroscience, theology, indigenous studies, cave art, and the history and effects of psychedelics have shed light on what was long thought to be unknowable.

Some such discoveries are too hot for history; their implications too radical for the disposition of academia. Challenging the very foundations of our social orders, they are above the pay grade of our professional storytellers. Addressing their implications requires braving the fringe rabbit holes of conspiracy theorists, chaos magicians, seers, skeptics, self-styled Indiana Jonseses and other 'alt-archaeologists'. In this seminar we will investigate the various discoveries, theories, and hypotheses of the contemporary discourses of pre-history — credentialed and crackpot alike — to project their consequences for the archetype of the architect.

We will begin with a wake up call from tech theorist Venkatesh Rao. Put simply, he sites the Promethean fire of Silicon Valley squarely in its anti-architectural metaphysics: "Big Men" like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos determine the "critical path" of "Big History" precisely because they subvert the zero sum thinking of an architectural worldview. To find agency for architecture in this regime, we look first to Keller Easterling and Mark Wigley. Easterling suggests designing "active forms"; Wigley suggests the power of architecture is bound up in its primacy as a metaphor. Together, they get us half way. To cross the finish line, we look to chaos magician Gordon White and the Ethereum block chain.

White's *Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits* allows us to speculate on the pre-history of Wigley's Derridean insights by recontextualizing the origins of architecture with new perspectives on the history of psychedelics, shamanism, star lore, the occult, and other esoteric knowledge, particularly magic. Ethereum's smart contracts allow us to make and deploy active forms into the world.

#### Deliverables
*We will decide on the course deliverable collectively in the first few weeks of class.*

#### Methodology
*We will update our driving methodology this year. See [here]() for a breakdown from last year.*

#### Bibliography
We will cull readings each week from [this ever-growing long list](bibliography.md) of books, manifestoes, essays, papers, reports, articles, videos, and social media posts.
